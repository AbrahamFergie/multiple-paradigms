# Multiple Paradigms

https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/124
Markdown parser implementations using three different programming paradigms: **object-oriented**, **functional**, and **imperative**.

Base repository for the [Multiple Paradigms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/124) goal.

## Installation and Setup

Work in progress: user will only need to run `npm i` from root directory to install dependencies. User will run `npm test` on terminal to test implementations.

To run the parser:
```
npm run parse:oo helloworld.md
//or
npm run parse:functional helloworld.md
//or 
npm run parse:imperative helloworld.md
```

## Usage and Examples

Implement a Markdown parser using three different programming paradigms: **object-oriented**, **functional**, and **imperative**.

Fork the [multiple-paradigms][multiple-paradigms] repository and use the fork as your project artifact.

The repository includes a skeleton script at `bin/parse` where you need to load and execute your Markdown parsers for each programming paradigm.

To parse a file, use the `npm run parse:<paradigm> <file.md>` command, where `<paradigm>` is one of either `oo` (object-oriented), `functional`, or `imperative` and `<file.md>` is a path to a Markdown-formatted file.

For example, say we have a file `hello.md` with the contents:

```shell-session
$ cat hello.md
_Hello_.

- My name is **Inigo Montoya**.
- You killed my father.
- Prepare to die.
```

...then the command `npm run parse:oo hello.md` (or `parse:functional`, or `parse:imperative`) should print the following:

```shell-session
$ npm run parse:oo hello.md
<p><em>Hello</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is <strong>Inigo Montoya</strong>.</li>
<li>You killed my father.</li>
<li>Prepare to die.</li>
</ul>
```

## Context

_Why is this goal important? How is it useful? What questions will it raise?_

Knowing how, when, and where to apply a particular _programming paradigms_ to a a piece of code is a key skill of any self-respecting software developer.

Being fluent in different paradigms will help you to think about and understand software architecture, and to make better design choices. It is also a crucial tool for communicating effectively with other developers.

## Quality Rubric

**Well formatted code**
- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]
- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]

**Clear and useful README**
- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]

**Proper dependency management**
- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]

**Good project management**
- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person. [25 points]
